    <h1>Re: Eileen Dover University Application</h1>

    <p>Dear Eileen,</p>

    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

<h2>Starting Dates</h2>
    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however, it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester. The start dates for each one are as follows:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><time datetime="2016-09-09">9 September 2016</time></li>
        <li><time datetime="2017-01-15">15 January 2017</time></li>
        <li><time datetime="2017-05-02">2 May 2017</time></li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can find more information about important university dates on our website.</p>

    <h2>Subjects of Study</h2>
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted, we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bass players at temperatures exceeding <strong>30°C (86°F)</strong>, when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>).</li>
        <li><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please provide more information on each subject.</p>

    <h2>Exotic Dance Moves</h2>
    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. My favorite dances are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Polynesian Chicken Dance:</strong> A village dance from 300<abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr>.</li>
        <li><strong>Icelandic Brownian Shuffle:</strong> A shuffle movement used before Icelanders discovered fire.</li>
        <li><strong>Arctic Robot Dance:</strong> Misidentified dance by English explorers in the 1960s.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
