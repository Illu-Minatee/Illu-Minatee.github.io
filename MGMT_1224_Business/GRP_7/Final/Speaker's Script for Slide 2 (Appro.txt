Speaker's Script for Slide 2 (Approx. 1 minute)
This is what one of your group members would actually say while the slide is displayed.

(Formal Greeting)
"Good morning, JB and members of the board."

(The Hook)
"According to research from IBM, the number of executives with the title 'Chief AI Officer' has nearly tripled in just the last five years."

(Connect the Hook to the Board)
"This explosive growth isn't just a tech trend; it's a powerful signal of a massive shift in how successful companies approach strategy, talent, and leadership. The ability to harness technologies like AI is rapidly becoming the dividing line between market leaders and those who are left behind."

(Introduce the Agenda)
"That's why we're here today. We've researched the forces shaping the future of IT, and on our agenda for the next few minutes, we will cover three critical areas you see here:"

(Point to the screen/list )
"First, we'll identify the key trends shaping our talent pool and who we're competing against for top skills. Second, we'll look at the specific, evolving skillsets our teams need to win. And finally, we’ll return to that new executive role and discuss the strategic importance of the Chief AI Officer."



Speaker's Script for Slide 3 (Approx. 40 seconds)
"So, where is this talent shift happening most intensely? Our research shows the battle for top IT professionals is being fought on three main fronts."

(Gesture to the first column)
"First, AI and Machine Learning. This is no longer on the horizon; it is the single biggest driver of demand for new and specialized tech roles today."

(Gesture to the second column)
"Second, Cybersecurity. This has moved from a technical need to a critical business risk. The talent shortage is staggering. As Katherina Uribe's research shows, a full one-in-six cybersecurity positions in Canada currently sit empty, leaving companies vulnerable."

(Gesture to the third column)
"And finally, Cloud Computing. This is the essential foundation for our growth and scalability. Yet, nearly half of all businesses report that they struggle to find the cloud experts they need."

"The key takeaway for the board is that competition in these three areas is fierce, and we need a targeted strategy to secure the talent required to innovate and protect our business."




Speaker's Script for Slide 4 (Approx. 40 seconds)
"Given that competitive landscape, our next question was: what specific skills and roles do we need to focus on to stay ahead?"

(Gesture to the left side of the slide)
"On the left, you see the highly sought-after roles that are essential right now. These are the analysts, scientists, and developers who build and maintain our core systems. Securing this talent requires not just competitive salaries, but as our research from Robert Half confirms, desirable benefits and a strong work/life balance are now key differentiators."

(Gesture to the right side of the slide)
"But more importantly for our long-term strategy, the evolution of technology is creating entirely new specializations we need to anticipate. Two examples are 'AI Risk Monitoring,' which goes beyond simply using AI to actually managing its potential downsides, and 'Quantum Cybersecurity,' a crucial field that will protect our data from the threat of future quantum computers."

"The strategic takeaway here is that we must recruit for today's needs while simultaneously planning and upskilling for tomorrow's challenges."




Speaker's Script for Slide 5 (Approx. 40 seconds)
"This rapid evolution in technology and skills presents both a huge opportunity and a significant management challenge. How do we ensure all these complex initiatives are managed effectively and aligned with our core business strategy?"

"The market's answer is the emergence of a new executive role: the Chief AI Officer, or CAIO."

(Gesture to the slide's content)
"As our research from IBM and others shows, the CAIO isn't just another IT manager. This is a strategic leader responsible for orchestrating the company’s entire AI ecosystem—from building talented teams to ensuring AI is used effectively and ethically."

"To succeed, a CAIO must possess a rare combination of skills: the technical expertise to understand the technology, the strategic vision to see its market potential, and the ethical insight to ensure we deploy it responsibly."

"For the board, the key consideration is that as AI becomes more central to our operations, dedicated, high-level leadership becomes essential for maximizing returns and minimizing risks."




Speaker's Script for Slide 6 (Approx. 1 minute)
"So, to bring everything together, we've highlighted three crucial takeaways for the board today:"

(Point to each item as you summarize it)
"First, the battle for IT talent is concentrated in the high-demand, high-impact fields of AI, cybersecurity, and cloud computing. Second, to win that battle, we must not only recruit for today's roles but also proactively build the skills needed for the innovations of tomorrow. And third, this complexity is driving a need for dedicated strategic oversight."

(The connection back to the hook)
"This brings me directly back to our opening statistic: the explosive, near-tripling of the Chief AI Officer role in just five years."

(The Final, Powerful Message)
"That number isn't just an interesting trend; it's a strategic verdict being rendered by the market. Leading companies are making their decision. Our core recommendation today is that we begin the conversation about what dedicated AI leadership should look like for our own organization. This will ensure we are positioned to lead this technological shift, not just react to it."

(Transition to the final slide)
"Thank you for your time."










Potential Question 1: The Practical Pushback

JB's Question: "This is all very forward-looking, but a Chief AI Officer sounds expensive and adds another layer to our executive team. Our Chief Technology Officer (CTO) already handles technology. Why can't the CTO just manage this?"

Your Answer:
"That's an excellent question and a very common one. Our research suggests that while there's some overlap, the roles are fundamentally different in focus.

The CTO's primary role is to build and maintain the company's core technology infrastructure and security—they ensure the 'engine' is running reliably and safely.

The CAIO, on the other hand, is a highly specialized, strategic role focused on integrating a single, transformative technology—AI—across all business departments, from marketing to finance to HR. Their job isn't just managing the tech; it's about ensuring AI initiatives are ethical, compliant with regulations, and, most importantly, directly drive business growth and revenue.

So, while the CTO manages the infrastructure, the CAIO is responsible for harnessing AI to create new market opportunities. For companies where AI is becoming central to strategy, this dedicated focus is what provides the competitive edge."

Potential Question 2: The Critical Thinking / Risk Assessment



JB's Question: "You focused a lot on the positive trends, especially AI creating new jobs. Did your research find any conflicting information? What are the biggest risks or downsides we should be worried about?"

Your Answer:
"That's a critical point, and yes, our research absolutely highlights that this transformation isn't without risk.

The primary conflict in the research is the 'job creation vs. job displacement' debate. While AI creates new, specialized roles like 'AI Risk Monitor,' it will inevitably automate or change existing roles, particularly those involving repetitive data analysis. The key challenge isn't a net loss of jobs, but a massive need for reskilling our current workforce.

The second major risk, which the CAIO role is specifically designed to address, is ethical and reputational. Using AI incorrectly can introduce bias into decision-making, compromise customer data, and lead to significant legal and brand damage.

So, the biggest risk isn't the technology itself, but a lack of a clear strategy for managing its impact on both our people and our processes. It’s a force that must be actively managed, not just deployed."
Potential Question 3: The Action-Oriented "What Now?"



JB's Question: "This has been very informative. Thank you. But what's our 'Monday morning' action plan? What is the single most important, low-cost first step you'd recommend we take based on what you've learned?"

Your Answer:
"That's the perfect question. Our primary recommendation wouldn't be to immediately hire a CAIO, but to first understand our own internal landscape.

The most important, low-cost first step would be to form a small, cross-departmental task force. This task force, comprised of leaders from IT, finance, and operations, would be responsible for two things over the next quarter:

An 'AI Audit': To map out all the ways we are currently using—or could be using—AI and automation in our business.

A 'Skills Gap Analysis': To assess our current team’s readiness for these technologies.

The outcome would be a data-driven report to this board that shows exactly where our biggest opportunities and weaknesses are. That report would give us a clear foundation to decide on the necessity and timing for a dedicated leadership role. It's a low-risk way to ensure our next step is a strategic one."
